INTRODUCTION
------------
This is tanishqdaiya's neovim configuration, based on the personal preferences
of tanishqdaiya. These configuration files can serve as an excellent starting
point or guide for anyone seeking to configure neovim. The philosophy behind
the design and overall functionality is to keep everything as minimal as
possible and not making things overwhelming by introducing difficulties. As for
me, this configuration is also stolen from various people as for all the
knowledge in this world You are welcome to suggest changes, or to clone the
repository and embark your own journey. To whoever who reads it, I wish you
well.

STATUS

Presently, I am displeased with the existing LSP keybinds and seek to address
this issue. While the theme functions adequately, it remains unsatisfactory.
Other previously highlighted problems have been resolved.
