Currently I am not very happy with the current lsp configuration so I would
like to fix that and the keybindings for text manipulation and copy-paste must
be added. I am also thinking of clearing out some bloat packages I have
installed and not liked one bit. An example of that might be the which-key.nvim
and netrw.nvim extension. Both of them are bloat and not required for the
smooth functioning of the editor. Both serve as rather the opposite and does
not help the developer.

The theme is also not satisfactory, but functional.
